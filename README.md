# Caltrans PEMS
This package provides tools to help you pull data from the [CalTrans PeMS](http://pems.dot.ca.gov/) database 
programmatically. The code in this repository was adapted from [get-pems](https://github.com/brianhigh/get-pems), 
which implemented similar functionality in the **R** programming language.
